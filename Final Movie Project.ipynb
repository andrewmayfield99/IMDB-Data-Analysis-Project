    "# 1. **Project Overview and Dataset Selection** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project marks my first official data analysis project, and as such, I intend to document my entire process in detail, ensuring a thorough understanding of each step involved. My goal is not just to analyze IMDb movie data but also to develop a strong foundation in data handling, cleaning, visualization, and interpretation. By explaining every decision I make, from data preparation to final insights, I hope to build a structured approach that I can refine and apply to future projects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will be working with multiple datasets from IMDb, which provide extensive information about movies, TV shows, ratings, crew members, genres, and voting trends. This data presents an opportunity to explore key questions such as how movie ratings have changed over time, whether runtime affects a film’s success, and the correlation between votes and popularity. Given the variety and complexity of the dataset, my approach will involve multiple tools and techniques to ensure a comprehensive analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I will primarily be using **Python within VS Code** for coding and data manipulation, leveraging libraries such as **Pandas** for data munging, **NumPy** for numerical operations, and **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization. The flexibility of **Jupyter Notebook** will allow me to document and test my code in an interactive format, making it easier to track my workflow and present my findings clearly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond Python, I will incorporate **Tableau** for interactive visualizations and dashboards, helping to uncover patterns in the data more intuitively. **MySQL** will be used for structured querying and database management, allowing me to practice handling large datasets efficiently. Additionally, I plan to experiment with **Microsoft Excel** for quick exploratory analysis and possibly utilize **Power BI** and **SAS** for further insights, depending on the complexity of my findings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By using a mix of programming, database management, and visualization tools, I aim to gain a well-rounded understanding of data analysis in a real-world setting. This project will not only strengthen my technical skills but also improve my ability to interpret and communicate data-driven insights effectively. Since this is my first deep dive into an extensive dataset, I anticipate challenges along the way, from data cleaning to ensuring my visualizations accurately reflect meaningful trends. However, by documenting my thought process and methodology step by step, I hope to create a structured and insightful analysis that can serve as a strong portfolio project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclaimer  \n",
    "While this dataset contains a large amount of data within many different variables, this project is focused on making general observations and analyses of the IMDb movie dataset. The scope of this analysis is limited to examining overall film data, such as runtime, release years, and average ratings. It does not include an in-depth exploration of specific genres, television shows, video games, or individual actors and directors. While these aspects may be considered in future projects, they are not within the scope of this study. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why and How I Chose This Specific Dataset\n",
    "When selecting a dataset, I explored numerous sources, including **Kaggle, Google Dataset Search, Reddit, and GitHub**. While these platforms offer a vast selection of datasets across various domains, I encountered a recurring issue: many datasets contained inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and missing information that only became apparent after I had already begun working on them. While data cleaning is an essential skill in data analysis, I did not want to spend the majority of my time correcting errors from unknown sources rather than conducting meaningful analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure reliability and minimize time spent fixing fundamental data quality issues, I decided to look for an official dataset from a well-established source. After extensive searching, I came across the **IMDb dataset**, which is released and maintained by IMDb itself. The dataset is updated regularly and provides structured, well-documented information about movies, TV shows, ratings, cast and crew, genres, and more. Since IMDb is one of the most reputable and widely used databases for film and television data, I felt confident that this dataset would provide a solid foundation for analysis without the risk of major inconsistencies or unreliable data entries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By selecting an official dataset that is structured and relatively clean, I can focus more on **exploratory data analysis, trend identification, and visualization**, rather than spending excessive time on fixing errors from an unknown origin. This decision aligns with my goal of developing a structured and insightful analysis while ensuring that the dataset I work with is both credible and valuable for meaningful conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Analyze Movie Data?\n",
    "Movies have been a significant part of global culture, shaping entertainment, storytelling, and even societal trends. With the rise of online platforms like IMDb (Internet Movie Database), movie ratings and popularity have become **quantifiable** through user reviews, votes, and engagement metrics. This dataset, containing thousands of movies spanning decades, provides an opportunity to explore **how movies have evolved over time** and **what makes a film well-received**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of This Analysis\n",
    "This project aims to explore IMDb movie and TV show data by analyzing key factors such as ratings, runtime, popularity, and trends over time. Using the seven datasets provided, we will investigate the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are movies getting better or worse over time? Analyzing `title.ratings.tsv.gz` to see if IMDb ratings have increased or declined over different decades (`startYear`).  \n",
    "- How has movie length evolved? Examining `title.basics.tsv.gz` (`runtimeMinutes`) to determine whether movies have become longer or shorter over time.   \n",
    "- Do longer movies get better ratings? Exploring `runtimeMinutes` vs. `averageRating` to find the optimal movie length.  \n",
    "- Do highly rated movies receive more votes? Comparing `numVotes` to `averageRating` to determine if popular movies are also critically well-received.  \n",
    "- How have IMDb voting patterns changed over time? Using `title.ratings.tsv.gz` and `startYear` to analyze whether newer movies receive more votes than older classics.  \n",
    "- Are movies being produced at a higher rate than in the past? Analyzing the number of unique `tconst` entries per year in `title.basics.tsv.gz`.   \n",
    "\n",

    "In this step, I will conduct an in-depth exploration of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and potential insights. The goal of EDA is to develop a strong understanding of the data by summarizing its main characteristics, identifying missing values, detecting anomalies, and analyzing distributions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since I will be using **Tableau** for all visualizations, I will generate relevant plots and charts in Tableau and incorporate them into this notebook for further analysis. This approach allows for a more interactive and dynamic exploration of the data. Key aspects of the EDA process will include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary Statistics:** Examining measures such as count, mean, median, min/max values, and standard deviation for numerical columns.  \n",
    "- **Data Distributions:** Understanding how different variables are distributed to detect any skewness or outliers.  \n",
    "- **Relationships Between Variables:** Analyzing correlations and patterns between key features such as runtime, rating, number of votes, and release year.  \n",
    "- **Categorical Data Analysis:** Exploring the distribution of categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of the data presented in my analysis, I conducted independent research on the history and evolution of the movie industry. This research helped contextualize the trends observed in the dataset, such as the dominance of short films in total count, the rise of highly rated films over time, and variations in audience engagement through ratings and votes.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Ratings and Audience Engagement**  \n",
    "   - I researched how audience preferences and rating behaviors have changed over time, especially with the advent of online review platforms like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Letterboxd.  \n",
    "   - I analyzed how short films tend to receive fewer votes but higher average ratings due to a more niche and appreciative audience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Studying Film Technology and Runtime Trends**  \n",
    "   - I explored how film technology advancements have influenced movie runtime and content.  \n",

    "## Basic Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This table provides key statistics about movies and short films, including **average ratings, total number of films, high-rated films, number of votes, and average runtime**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Average Ratings**\n",
    "- The **overall average rating** across all titles is **6.383**.\n",
    "- **Movies have a slightly lower average rating (6.158)** compared to **short films (6.820)**.  \n",
    "  - This suggests that short films may receive more favorable ratings on average, potentially due to **a more niche audience** or **higher appreciation among viewers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Total Number of Films**\n",
    "- There are **1,747,790 total films**, categorized into:\n",
    "  - **705,351 movies**  \n",
    "  - **1,042,439 short films**  \n",
    "- Short films **outnumber movies** significantly, making up **nearly 60% of all titles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Distribution of Highly Rated Films**\n",
    "- **157,089 films (≈9% of all films) have a rating above 7.0**.  \n",
    "- **57,631 films (≈3.3% of all films) have a rating above 8.0**.  \n",
    "- **12,847 films (≈0.7% of all films) have a rating above 9.0**, making them the **elite tier** of highly rated films.  \n",
    "- Interestingly, short films have **more films rated above 9.0 (9,268) than movies (3,579)**.  \n",
    "  - This supports the earlier observation that **short films receive more extreme positive ratings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Average Number of Votes**\n",
    "- **Movies receive significantly more votes (3,629 per movie)** compared to **short films (76 per short film)**.  \n",
    "  - This suggests that movies **garner more widespread attention and engagement** from viewers.  \n",
    "  - Short films may be **highly rated but receive fewer votes**, potentially due to **a smaller, dedicated audience**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Average Runtime**\n",
    "- The **overall average runtime** is **43.649 minutes**, but it differs drastically between categories:\n",
    "  - **Movies average 89.710 minutes (~1.5 hours).**\n",
    "  - **Short films average just 13.092 minutes.**  \n",
    "  - The shorter length of short films might contribute to **higher ratings**, as shorter content often has **tighter storytelling and higher engagement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusions**\n",
    "- **Short films dominate in quantity but have fewer total votes per title.**  \n",
    "- **Movies attract more audience engagement**, reflected in their significantly higher number of votes.  \n",
    "- **High ratings are more common among short films**, but this may be due to **a more selective and appreciative audience**.  \n",
    "- **Very few films (0.7%) achieve a rating above 9.0**, making them the **top-tier masterpieces**.  \n",
    "- The difference in runtime strongly **distinguishes movies from short films**, with short films being significantly shorter but often higher rated."

    "## Graph 1: Analysis: Average Rating & Number of Films vs. Runtime in Minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This graph visualizes the relationship between film runtime and two key metrics:\n",
    "- **Average rating** (blue line) on the left y-axis.\n",
    "- **Number of films released** (red bars) on the right y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "1. **Initial Increase in Average Ratings:**\n",
    "   - Films with runtimes between 0 and 15 minutes show a rapid increase in average ratings.\n",
    "   - This suggests that shorter films (likely shorts) might have higher viewer satisfaction or quality control.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Peak in Average Ratings (~20-40 minutes):**\n",
    "   - The ratings stabilize around 6.8 to 7.0 within this range before experiencing fluctuations.\n",
    "   - This could indicate a sweet spot where films are neither too short nor too long for audience engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decline in Ratings (~40-80 minutes):**\n",
    "   - A notable downward trend is observed between 40 and 80 minutes, with ratings gradually declining.\n",
    "   - This could be attributed to lower production quality or engagement issues in mid-length films.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Volatility Beyond 80 Minutes:**\n",
    "   - The ratings fluctuate significantly beyond this point, with peaks and troughs.\n",
    "   - Some longer films (~100+ minutes) show higher ratings, which may reflect well-produced feature-length films.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Distribution of Films by Runtime:**\n",
    "   - The highest concentration of films appears to be in the 80-100 minute range.\n",
    "   - This aligns with standard feature-length films, suggesting that most productions fall within this duration.\n",
    "   - However, there are occasional spikes at specific runtimes (e.g., around 120 minutes and 180 minutes), possibly indicating common runtime choices for major productions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rare Occurrences of Extremely Long Films:**\n",
    "   - Films longer than 150 minutes are scarce but tend to have relatively high average ratings.\n",
    "   - This suggests that longer films might be more carefully crafted and well-received by audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Insights\n",
    "- **Mean and Median Runtime:** Likely concentrated around 80-100 minutes.\n",
    "- **Skewness:** The distribution of the number of films appears to be right-skewed, meaning shorter films are more common.\n",
    "- **Potential Outliers:** Some extremely long films with high ratings suggest either cult classics or high-budget productions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This graph highlights an important trade-off between runtime and audience reception. While shorter films generally receive favorable ratings, feature-length films (~90 minutes) dominate the industry. Longer films, while fewer in number, tend to be critically acclaimed, possibly due to higher production quality.\n",

    "### **Key Observations**\n",
    "1. **Short Films (0-30 minutes)**:\n",
    "   - The number of films is high in this range, peaking around the **5-10 minute mark**.\n",
    "   - Films with runtimes of **5-15 minutes tend to have high average ratings (~6.8 to 7.1)**.\n",
    "   - After 15 minutes, there is a **gradual decline in average rating**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Moderate-Length Films (30-90 minutes)**:\n",
    "   - There is a **notable dip in average ratings**, reaching the lowest point (~5.8) around **80 minutes**.\n",
    "   - The number of films also decreases significantly in this range.\n",
    "   - The ratings trend suggests that shorter films (below 30 minutes) or longer ones (above 90 minutes) tend to be rated higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature-Length Films (90-120 minutes)**:\n",
    "   - Average ratings start to **increase steadily after 90 minutes**.\n",
    "   - The number of films in this range is lower compared to shorter films but still significant.\n",
    "   - Films around **120 minutes** have noticeably **better average ratings (~6.5 to 6.7).**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Long Films (Above 120 minutes)**:\n",
    "   - The average rating continues **rising beyond 120 minutes**, reaching **7.0+ in the 160-170 minute range**.\n",
    "   - The number of films released in this range is significantly lower.\n",
    "   - This suggests that **longer films tend to be rated higher**, possibly due to factors like higher production budgets or greater storytelling depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Statistical Trends**\n",
    "- **U-Shaped Rating Distribution**: \n",
    "  - Ratings are higher for very short and very long films, with a dip in mid-range runtimes.\n",
    "- **Inverse Relationship Between Quantity and Rating**:\n",
    "  - The **most common runtimes (short films)** do not necessarily have the best ratings.\n",
    "  - **Longer films, though less frequent, tend to receive better ratings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- The data suggests that **short films (under 15 minutes) and long films (over 120 minutes) are generally well-received**.\n",
    "- There is a **clear dip in ratings for films between 60-90 minutes**, which could indicate lower production value or weaker narratives.\n",

    "### **Overview**\n",
    "This graph examines the relationship between a film's **number of votes** and its **average rating**. It provides insight into how audience engagement (as measured by the number of votes) correlates with perceived film quality (as measured by average ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Observations**\n",
    "1. **Highly-Rated Films with Few Votes**\n",
    "   - Films with very few votes tend to have extreme ratings (either very high or very low).\n",
    "   - Some films with fewer than 10,000 votes have **ratings close to 10**, likely due to niche appeal or dedicated fanbases.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Majority of Films Cluster Around 6-8 Ratings**\n",
    "   - The majority of films, especially those with moderate vote counts (10K - 500K), tend to have ratings between **6 and 8**.\n",
    "   - This suggests that as a film receives more votes, its rating stabilizes within a predictable range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Films with Extremely High Votes**\n",
    "   - Movies with over **1 million votes** generally have ratings above **7**, with very few exceptions.\n",
    "   - This indicates that widely popular films tend to be well-received, as films with poor reception rarely accumulate such high vote counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lower-Rated Films and Vote Count**\n",
    "   - The lowest-rated films (ratings below **5**) tend to have fewer votes.\n",
    "   - This suggests that poorly rated films may not be widely watched, limiting audience engagement.\n",

    "- There is a **strong positive correlation** between a film’s popularity (vote count) and the likelihood of having a higher rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- Films with low vote counts can be highly polarizing, leading to extreme ratings.\n",
    "- As a film receives more votes, its rating tends to stabilize, converging towards the **6-8 range**.\n",
    "- Highly popular films generally receive higher ratings, suggesting that mainstream movies tend to be better received or more widely appreciated.\n",

    "     - The rise of digital filmmaking, streaming platforms, and independent films.\n",
    "     - More widespread internet access, allowing a larger number of people to rate films.\n",
    "     - The globalization of film industries leading to more diverse content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Steady Growth in Films Rated Above 9.0**\n",
    "   - The number of films rated **above 9.0** has also increased over time, but the growth is **slower** compared to films rated **above 7.0 or 8.0**.\n",
    "   - The highest count of **films with > 9.0 ratings** was recorded in **2023** (1,125 films).\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Possible Explanations for Trends**\n",
    "- **Increase in Film Production**: More movies are being made each year, leading to a natural increase in the number of highly rated films.\n",
    "- **Changing Audience Preferences**: Modern audiences might be more generous with ratings, especially on online platforms.\n",
    "- **Streaming & Accessibility**: More people now have access to international films, leading to wider appreciation and higher ratings.\n",
    "- **Nostalgia & Bias in Ratings**: Older films may have fewer ratings overall, impacting their presence in higher-rating categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- The number of highly rated films has **significantly increased over the past two decades**, with peaks around 2017 and 2023.\n",
    "- Films rated **above 7.0 and 8.0** have grown exponentially, while films rated **above 9.0** remain relatively rare but are increasing.\n",
